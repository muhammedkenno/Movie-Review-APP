<p align="center"><h1>Movie reviewing App ï·½</h1></p>

I built this app using a variety of tools:
Frontend:
.HTML to create the page structure
.CSS to style and layout the elements
.JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior

Backend:
.Node.js to create the web server
.Express.js to build a RESTful API
.MongoDB for the database

Features:
Search for movies by title, actor, or director
Browse movies by genre or release date
Read movie summaries and watch trailers
Rate movies and write reviews
Share your ratings and reviews with friends

Future plans:
Add more features, such as the ability to create custom movie lists
Improve the app's design and user interface
Deploy the app to different platforms
